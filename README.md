# **Immigration Insights: A Data-Driven Visualization of Non-Permanent Residents in Canada (2021-2024)**

## **Project Overview:**
Welcome to the **Mass Immigration in Canada** project, a comprehensive data analytics endeavor designed to provide valuable insights into the trends, patterns, and distributions of non-permanent residents (Non-PRs) in Canada from 2021 to 2024. Our team aims to develop a dynamic Tableau Dashboard to analyze and visualize key aspects of mass immigration, focusing on categories such as asylum claimants, permit holders, and other related groups. This project serves as an essential tool for stakeholders, including the IRCC, the Government of Canada, and potential immigrants, by addressing critical business questions related to immigration dynamics in the country.

## **Prerequisites:**
Before embarking on this project, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Data Analysis:** A good understanding of data analysis techniques, including familiarity with tools such as Tableau and Excel.
  
- **Data Visualization:** Proficiency in Tableau, with the ability to create and customize dashboards to effectively communicate data-driven insights.
  
- **Python Programming (Optional):** While not mandatory, knowledge of Python and libraries such as Pandas can be beneficial for data preparation and transformation.
  
- **Understanding of Immigration Data:** Basic knowledge of immigration processes and categories (e.g., asylum claimants, work permits) will enhance the analysis.

## **Project Materials:**
This project includes the following materials to guide you through the development and analysis process:

- **Data Collection:** Access the dataset on non-permanent residents from Statistics Canada to gather relevant data from 2021 to 2024.
  
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Use tools like Excel or Python to clean and prepare the dataset, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the data for analysis.
  
- **Dashboard Design:** A detailed Tableau workbook containing all visualizations and analyses, with a focus on answering the predefined business questions.
  
- **Project Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation outlining the steps, methodologies, and insights gained throughout the project, ensuring reproducibility and clarity for future reference.

## **Business Problem/Opportunity:**
The dataset provides an opportunity to explore and understand the dynamics of mass immigration in Canada. By analyzing categories such as asylum claimants, permit holders, and other non-permanent residents, this project will generate insights that can assist in decision-making for the IRCC, Government of Canada, and potential immigrants. The dashboard will address the following business questions:

- **Trends Over Time:** How has the total number of non-permanent residents changed quarterly from 2021 to 2024?
  
- **Distribution Trends:** What are the distribution trends of asylum claimants and related categories by quarter?
  
- **Seasonal Variations:** What seasonal variations exist in the number of Non-PRs with study and work permits?
  
- **Growth Rates:** Which category of Non-PRs showed the highest growth rate?
  
- **Provincial Analysis:** Which province has experienced the most significant increase in total permit holders and their family members?
  
- **Work Permit Trends:** Which province saw the highest number of work permit holders from Q1 2022 to Q3 2023?
  
- **Asylum Claimants:** What are the top 3 provinces with the fewest asylum claimants holding work permits from 2021 to 2024?
  
- **Non-PR Thresholds:** In which quarter did Nova Scotia exceed 52,000 Non-PRs?
  
- **Study Permit Holders:** What trend did study permit holders in Ontario experience during the specified period?
  
- **Category Growth:** Which province and category saw significant growth in 2022 and 2023?
  
- **Provincial Comparisons:** Which province has the highest and lowest number of Non-PRs, and what are their percentages compared to the total population?
  
- **Study Permits Issued:** How many study permits were issued in 2023 and 2024, and what insights can be drawn?
  
- **Transition Rates:** What is the yearly percentage of transitions from study permits to work permits across provinces and nationally?
  
- **Category Ratios:** Which Non-PR category has the highest ratio, and what are the ratios of each category?

## **Conclusion:**
This project provides a structured approach to understanding mass immigration in Canada through data analysis and visualization. By following this guide and utilizing the provided materials, users will be able to develop a comprehensive Tableau Dashboard that offers valuable insights into the characteristics and trends of non-permanent residents in Canada, aiding in informed decision-making for stakeholders.
